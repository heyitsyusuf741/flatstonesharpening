      #### Surgical Instrument

      Bandage shears need to cut through coarse material. They need to hold an edge for long. We put a bevel edge on the bandange scissors that we sharpen.

      #### Clipper Blade

      Clippers that cut hair are not the same as those that have handle furr. Our equipment are callibrated for each type of clipper blade. We mod T-Outliners as well.

      #### Hairdressing Shear

      Slide cutting is easiest with a blade that's not just sharp enough but also the right shape. We put a convex edge on the hairdressers’ shears that we sharpen.
