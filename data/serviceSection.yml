      #### Surgical Instrument Sharpening

      Bandage shears need to cut through coarse material. They need to hold an edge for long. We put a bevel edge on the bandange scissors that we sharpen.

      #### Hairdressing Shear Sharpening

      Slide cutting is easiest with a blade that's not just sharp enough but also the right shape. We put a convex edge on the hairdressersâ€™ shears that we sharpen.
